# 0x02. ES6 classes
# Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. 
# Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.
# Classes are in fact "special functions", and just as you can define function expressions and function declarations,or # a class can be defined in two ways: a class expression or a class declaration.
# Like function expressions, class expressions may be anonymous, or have a name that's different from the variable that # it's assigned to. However, unlike function declarations, class declarations have the same temporal dead zone
# restrictions as let or const and behave as if they are not hoisted.
# The body of a class is the part that is in curly braces {}. This is where you define class members, such as methods or# constructor.

# The body of a class is executed in strict mode even without the "use strict" directive.

# A class element can be characterized by three aspects:

# Kind: Getter, setter, method, or field
# Location: Static or instance
# Visibility: Public or private
# Together, they add up to 16 possible combinations. To divide the reference more logically and avoid overlapping
# content, the different elements are introduced in detail in different pages:

# Method definitions
# Public instance method

# getter
# Public instance getter

# setter
# Public instance setter

# Public class fields
# Public instance field

# static
# Public static method, getter, setter, and field

# Private properties
# Everything that's private
